# Holberton Smiling School

## Description

This project implements a design from scratch using HTML and Bootstrap as much as possible. Additional customized styling is added using pure CSS. This project duplicates the visual design of a fully functional website consisting of 3 pages that can be seen as 3 separate Figma designer files.

The Homepage is found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/QYQqMYbdpAHL5xTclwJKSI/Homepage?node-id=0%3A1).

The Pricing page is found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/KLAI53jdYpfFNEy0O79ymB/Pricing?node-id=0%3A1).

The Courses page is found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ivg3abH1HLmMayBgjGg1Qf/Courses?node-id=0%3A1).

Each page contains links to the other two pages via a working navigation bar.

## Examples

Full desktop and mobile examples for all 3 pages are shown here:

## Project Rules

- You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, so you are free to implement it the way that you want. The objective is simple: Create a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
- Your styles.css must be as small as you can. You must use Bootstrap classes as much as you can.

## Project Advice

- You will need: JQuery, Bootstrap CSS/JSS (links/scripts provided)
- If your computer has missing fonts, you can find it here: [source-sans-pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro)
- Images and holberton_school-icon font are included in zip found [here](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1687)

## Features

- Pricing and courses pages include link back to homepage.
- An attempt was made at accessability. No Axe issues except "Elements must have sufficient color contrast" which is a design element I have no control over.
- I personally think it's very cleanly written and laid out :)

## Bugs

- These pages ideally look best at 1440px, 768px, and 375px as shown in the Figma designer file.
- Text size is not responsive.
- The background of headers does not match for homepage or pricing pages on mobile view.
- "Most popular tutorials" and "Latest tutorials" carousels are not multi-item carousels. They are single-item carousels with 2 cards each.
- Styling on "Most popular tutorials" and "Latest tutorials" carousels is a little off, most notably the "play" overlay and previous/next arrows.
